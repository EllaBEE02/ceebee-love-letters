          <p>
            I want to remind you of the depth of my love for you, a love that
            remains steadfast even when I fall short of being the partner you
            deserve.
          </p>

            You are an extraordinary man — patient, strong, and kind. It’s those
            very qualities that drew me to you, and it’s those same qualities
            that inspire me to be better. I don’t want to lose what we have
            built together, and I am willing to put in the effort to regain your
            trust and heal the wounds I’ve caused.
          </p>

            No matter how difficult these moments feel, I refuse to let it
            define us. I see so much beauty in what we’ve been through together.
            You are my partner, my confidant, my lover, and I will never stop
            fighting for us.
          </p>

            My wish for you this <strong>new year</strong> is that God's love
            becomes the foundation on which our family will stand. I pray His
            Grace becomes so evident in everything we do and that the family we
            build under His guidance becomes a beacon of joy, blessings and
            strength for all those around us in Jesus' name.
