            I want to remind you of the depth of my love for you, a love that
            remains steadfast even when I fall short of being the partner you
            deserve.

            You are an extraordinary man — patient, strong, and kind. It’s those
            very qualities that drew me to you, and it’s those same qualities
            that inspire me to be better. I don’t want to lose what we have
            built together, and I am willing to put in the effort to regain your
            trust and heal the wounds I’ve caused.

            No matter how difficult these moments feel, I refuse to let it
            define us. I see so much beauty in what we’ve been through together.
            You are my partner, my confidant, my lover, and I will never stop
            fighting for us.

            My wish for you this <strong>new year</strong> is that God's love
            becomes the foundation on which our family will stand. I pray His
            Grace becomes so evident in everything we do and that the family we
            build under His guidance becomes a beacon of joy, blessings and
            strength for all those around us in Jesus' name.

            Sometimes I wish I was a little older, a lot wiser and much, much
            stable enough to be accountable for you. You've been through so much
            and it is my desire to fill your life with happiness and joy. I pray
            God gives me the grace to come through and be there whenever you
            need me.

            Today, Orchua told me that sending reels back and forth between a
            couple is a love language. Do you agree?😅 I'll learn and update the
            interface soon so you can respond. Help me ask God for speed in my
            learnings.

            Can we do a movie night next weekend? I heard there's a streaming
            app where we can both watch the same thing at the same time. I'll
            see if it's doable and make it a date. What do you think? Wanna pick
            a movie?🥰 The lack of functionality on this website is really
            becoming a cause for concern. Who designed this??😂

            I ask this day for a little list, my love, a list of a few things
            you love me to do or continue doing for you. Anything apart from me
            going to re-make my hair right now tho'😂

            I wish I was with you right now. I choose to be with you everyday
            and I want to know more about you even as we're far apart. So please
            answer these 3 questions:
            <li>What is the most romantic place you’ve ever visited?</li>
            <li>What was your favourite go-to after-school snack?</li>
            <li>
              Do you think we would have been friends or dated if we’d known
              each other in high school?
            </li>

            Even when my visions don’t perfectly align with yours, I choose to
            stand by you. Together, we are stronger, wiser, and capable of
            achieving what neither of us could alone.
